! WARNING !

Actually repo dir is equivalent to termux dir...
I dont recommend you just replace the zshrc, or oh-my-zsh.rc in fact this zshrc is my own actual zshrc, i recommend you understand and analyse to modify your own zshrc (of course if you use zsh like me) if you use other shell like bash,fish,etc may need some adaptation...
